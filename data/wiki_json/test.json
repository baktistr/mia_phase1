  "In humans , this signalling role is important in both the central and peripheral nervous system . Activity @-@ dependent release of ATP from synapses , axons and glia activates purinergic membrane receptors known as P2 . The P2Y receptors are metabotropic , i.e. G protein @-@ coupled and modulate mainly intracellular calcium and sometimes cyclic AMP levels . Though named between P2Y1 and P2Y15 , only nine members of the P2Y family have been cloned , and some are only related through weak homology and several ( P2Y5 , P2Y7 , P2Y9 , P2Y10 ) do not function as receptors that raise cytosolic calcium . The P2X ionotropic receptor subgroup comprises seven members ( P2X1 – P2X7 ) , which are ligand @-@ gated Ca2 + -permeable ion channels that open when bound to an extracellular purine nucleotide . In contrast to P2 receptors ( agonist order ATP > ADP > AMP > ADO ) , purinergic nucleoside triphosphates like ATP are not strong agonists of P1 receptors , which are strongly activated by adenosine and other nucleosides ( ADO > AMP > ADP > ATP ) . P1 receptors have A1 , A2a , A2b , and A3 subtypes ( \" A \" as a remnant of old nomenclature of adenosine receptor ) , all of which are G protein @-@ coupled receptors , A1 and A3 being coupled to Gi , and A2a and A2b being coupled to Gs . All adenosine receptors were shown to activate at least one subfamily of mitogen @-@ activated protein kinases . The actions of adenosine are often antagonistic or synergistic to the actions of ATP . In the CNS , adenosine has multiple functions , such as modulation of neural development , neuron and glial signalling and the control of innate and adaptive immune systems .",
  "The isotope plutonium @-@ 239 is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons , due to its ease of fission and availability . Encasing the bomb 's plutonium pit in a tamper ( an optional layer of dense material ) decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach critical mass by reflecting escaping neutrons back into the plutonium core . This reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from 16 kg to 10 kg , which is a sphere with a diameter of about 10 centimeters ( 4 in ) . This critical mass is about a third of that for uranium @-@ 235 .",
  "There are four fundamental steps in the fusion process . First , the involved membranes must aggregate , approaching each other to within several nanometers . Second , the two bilayers must come into very close contact ( within a few angstroms ) . To achieve this close contact , the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated , as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel . The presence of ions , in particular divalent cations like magnesium and calcium , strongly affects this step . One of the critical roles of calcium in the body is regulating membrane fusion . Third , a destabilization must form at one point between the two bilayers , locally distorting their structures . The exact nature of this distortion is not known . One theory is that a highly curved \" stalk \" must form between the two bilayers . Proponents of this theory believe that it explains why phosphatidylethanolamine , a highly curved lipid , promotes fusion . Finally , in the last step of fusion , this point defect grows and the components of the two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact .",

  "Lindwall , widely regarded as one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time , bowled with a classical and artistic side @-@ on bowling action . David Frith wrote that \" there was a balance , rhythmic run , a build @-@ up \" and an \" ecstasy \" in his smooth delivery action . Richie Benaud said that Lindwall was \" technically the best fast bowler \" that he ever saw . During the 1950s , Lindwall 's action was copied by young children and a number of first @-@ class Australian bowlers , including Ron Gaunt , John Power and Barry Fisher consciously copied his action . Alan Davidson , who succeeded Lindwall as Australia 's pace spearhead , labelled him as \" the best fast bowler I ever saw \" . Lindwall 's childhood hero Harold Larwood rated Dennis Lillee to be equal to Lindwall \" but not ahead of him \" . Following Lindwall 's tour of England in 1953 , his English counterpart Alec Bedser said that Lindwall was \" the best fast bowler I 've seen , because of his variety and control \" . Lindwall was particularly known for his trademark outswinger , which swung late and at high pace . Fred Trueman believed that Lindwall 's ability to simultaneously swing the ball and at such pace and accuracy was matched only by himself and Wes Hall . Frank Tyson wrote that \" he appears to be just jogging his fifteen yards up to the stumps - until the last couple of strides of his approach , when he suddenly explodes into his delivery stride ... when he releases the ball , his bowling arm is so low that it borders on the round @-@ arm \" . Lindwall 's ability to swing the ball at high pace allowed him to repeatedly breach the defences of his opponents ; of his 228 Test wickets , 98 were bowled and another 31 were leg before wicket . Lindwall 's repertoire was reinforced with a dangerous yorker and bouncer , and changes of pace . As Tyson said \" who is not ' Lindy 's bunny ' when he slots his yorker in the right spot ? \" . In 1952 he developed an inswinger and then coupled it with his yorker , which homed into the feet of batsmen at high pace . Denis Compton said that Lindwall had the subtleties of a slow bowler , saying that he \" raised what is considered to be the labouring force of cricket [ fast bowling ] to an artform with his tactical shrewdness , control and variations \" . Lindwall 's emergence after the Second World War along with his new ball partner Keith Miller heralded a new era in cricket . The pair were regarded as the two best fast bowlers of their era , and signalled a change in the cricket landscape , which had been dominated during the interwar period by batsmen . Together the pair formed a new ball fast @-@ bowling combination regarded as one of the best in Test history . During the 1948 tour of England , the hosts had agreed to have a new ball available every 55 overs , and the Australians used this to unleash Lindwall and Miller on the Englishmen with a shiny new ball . The pair often targeted the leading opposition batsmen , particular England 's Len Hutton and Denis Compton with large amounts of short @-@ pitched bowling , raising fast bowling to a new standard . Hutton 's battles with Lindwall were regarded as one of the key match @-@ ups in Anglo @-@ Australian battles of the time , and Hutton said his opponent had the ability to \" strike at will \" . Hutton felt that Lindwall 's bouncers were the best that he faced , saying of their accuracy : \" You had to play them or be hit \" . Lindwall refused to bowl bouncers at tailenders , saying that \" If the day ever came when I have to bowl bouncers at tailenders then I won 't deserve to play for Australia \" . When England developed quality pace bowlers of their own in the 1950s , Hutton was captain and he implemented a similar strategy to that executed by Lindwall and Miller . In retirement , Lindwall went on to mentor Lillee , who went on to break the Test world record for wicket @-@ taking .",

  "Warbrick sailed to Australia for a leg of their tour described by historian Greg Ryan as \" little more than a testimony to the motives of Scott and Eyton as speculators . \" Their time in Australia started in Victoria , where the side mostly played Victorian Rules Football against Melbourne clubs .

  "Before the advent of laser technology , coherent radio sources were used for interferometry measurements of the speed of light . However interferometric determination of wavelength becomes less precise with wavelength and the experiments were thus limited in precision by the long wavelength ( ~ 0 @.@ 4 cm ) of the radiowaves . The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength , but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light . One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured , and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal . A laser can then be locked to the frequency , and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry . This technique was due to a group at the National Bureau of Standards ( NBS ) ( which later became NIST ) . They used it in 1972 to measure the speed of light in vacuum with a fractional uncertainty of 3 @.@ 5 × 10 − 9 .",

  "A study conducted by Boucher , Rydell , Loo , and Rydell has shown that stereotype threat not only affects performance , but can also affect the ability to learn new information . In the study , undergraduate men and women had a session of learning followed by an assessment of what they learned .

As a result , participants were split into four separate conditions : control group , stereotype threat only , stereotype threat removed before learning , and stereotype threat removed after learning . The results of the study showed that the women who were presented with the \" gender fair \" information performed better on the math related test than the women who were not presented with this information . This study also showed that it was more beneficial to women for the \" gender fair \" information to be presented prior to learning rather than after learning .

In the episode 's first draft , Gloria worked as a food truck driver , however this was later changed so that she instead worked as a police lady . Scully also stated that , in the scene after Homer carries Burns and Gloria up the stairs , there were originally a lot of jokes about Homer \" taking care of business \" for Burns , however the staff decided to leave it out since it would make Homer \" unlikable . \" In the episode , Snake Jailbird 's mailbox reads \" Snake ( Jailbird ) \" which is a reference to a debate that the writers had over whether Snake 's mailbox would read \" Snake \" or \" Jailbird \" . Originally , the episode would end with Burns taking the \" pocket fox \" extract , however when seeing the animatic , the writers felt that that ending would be \" too slow \" , so they changed it into Gloria falling in love with Snake again .",

  "Rainier and Linois had clashed in June 1803 , before news of the outbreak of war had reached India . Linois had anchored at Pondicherry , a French Indian port , and Rainier had led a powerful squadron to anchor off the harbour in anticipation of the declaration of war . Concerned that Rainier 's numerically superior force would overwhelm his squadron before they could operate against the British merchant convoys in the region , Linois slipped away under cover of darkness and eventually reached Île de France , where he learned that the Napoleonic Wars had begun on 16 May . Sailing to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies , Linois resupplied and then departed for a cruise in the South China Sea on 28 December , seeking the large annual convoy of HEIC merchant ships from Canton , known as the China Fleet . This convoy was normally escorted from Canton by several Royal Navy ships of the line , but in 1804 the escort had been delayed . Linois discovered the convoy near the island of Pulo Aura at the eastern entrance to the Strait of Malacca at 08 : 00 on 14 February and advanced . The convoy commander Commodore Nathaniel Dance had disguised several of the East Indiamen as ships of the line in the hope of convincing Linois that the convoy was well protected . Linois hesitated for over a day , eventually attacking on the morning of 15 February . Dance resisted and Linois withdrew without contesting the engagement . Dance 's merchant ships chased Linois 's squadron away before resuming their course and meeting their escorts several days later . Linois 's failure to engage and defeat the China Fleet infuriated a number of his officers and provoked an angry letter from Napoleon , who accused Linois of believing \" that war can be made without running risks \" .",

  "One definition sees language primarily as the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour : to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances . This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans , and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain . Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction . Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language ; for example , creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language . This view , which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes , understands language to be largely innate , for example , in Chomsky 's theory of Universal Grammar , or American philosopher Jerry Fodor 's extreme innatist theory . These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics .",

  "To the south of Mercia , Cynewulf came to the throne of Wessex in 757 and recovered much of the border territory that Æthelbald had conquered from the West Saxons . Offa won an important victory over Cynewulf at the Battle of Bensington ( in Oxfordshire ) in 779 , reconquering some of the land along the Thames .

In 786 , after the murder of Cynewulf , Offa may have intervened to place Beorhtric on the West Saxon throne .

  "This re @-@ appropriation of established texts , resources , and artistic properties to tell a story or make a statement is an example of a semiotic phenomenon known as intertextuality or resemiosis . A more common term for this phenomenon is “ parody ” , but not all of these intertextual productions are intended for humor or satire , as demonstrated by the Few Good G @-@ Men video . Furthermore , the argument of how well @-@ protected machinima is under the guise of parody or satire is still highly debated ; a piece of machinima may be reliant upon a protected property , but may not necessarily be making a statement about that property . Therefore , it is more accurate to refer to it simply as resemiosis , because it takes an artistic work and presents it in a new way , form , or medium . This resemiosis can be manifested in a number of ways . The machinima @-@ maker can be considered an author who restructures the story and / or the world that the chosen game engine is built around . In the popular web series Red vs. Blue , most of the storyline takes place within the game engine of Halo : Combat Evolved and its subsequent sequels . Halo : Combat Evolved has an extensive storyline already , but Red vs. Blue only ever makes mention of this storyline once in the first episode . Even after over 200 episodes of the show being broadcast onto the Internet since 2003 , the only real similarities that can be drawn between Red vs. Blue and the game @-@ world it takes place in are the character models , props , vehicles , and settings .

  "Though these ancient gardens shared some of the characteristics of present @-@ day botanical gardens , the forerunners of modern botanical gardens are generally regarded as being the medieval monastic physic gardens that originated after the decline of the Roman Empire at the time of Emperor Charlemagne ( 742 – 789 CE ) . These contained a hortus , a garden used mostly for vegetables , and another section set aside for specially labelled medicinal plants and this was called the herbularis or hortus medicus — more generally known as a physic garden , and a viridarium or orchard . These gardens were probably given impetus when Charlemagne issued a capitulary , the Capitulary de Villis , which listed 73 herbs to be used in the physic gardens of his dominions . Many of these were found in British gardens even though they only occurred naturally in continental Europe , demonstrating earlier plant introduction . Pope Nicholas V set aside part of the Vatican grounds in 1447 , for a garden of medicinal plants that were used to promote the teaching of botany , and this was a forerunner to the University gardens at Padua and Pisa established in the 1540s . Certainly the founding of many early botanic gardens was instigated by members of the medical profession .",
  "\" I sneaked up there a few times . And under the bright , unforgiving lights of television , I was able to encounter the real Michelangelo .

Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace . Adam ’ s famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke : a flick of the wrist , and the first man had his manhood . I also enjoyed his sense of humour , which , from close up , turned out to be refreshingly puerile .

  "Mark Mangini served as The Voyage Home 's sound designer .

Since many sounds familiar to Star Trek had been established — the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey 's cloaking device , the transporter beam , et al . — Mangini focused on making only small changes to them . The most important sounds were those of the whales and the probe . Mangini 's brother lived near biologist Roger Payne , who had recordings of whale song . Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest conversation and language . The probe 's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form . The humpback 's communication with the probe at the climax of the film contained no dramatic music , meaning that Mangini 's sounds had to stand alone . He recalled that he had difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold , leading Bennett to perform a puppet show to explain . Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini 's attempts to create the probe 's droning operating noise ; after more than a dozen attempts , the sound designer finally asked Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like .

  "Most people who move across the border are women and girls . The migration of Haitian women to the Dominican Republic is intrinsically linked to the “ feminization of migrations ” which is in turn part of the “ new Haitian immigration , ” brought about by changes in labor markets as well as by the fragile situation of women and their families in Haiti . Women migrants are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking , violence and illicit smuggling . When attempting to cross the border , Haitian women are at risk of being robbed , assaulted , raped and murdered , at the hands of smugglers , delinquents and traffickers , both Dominican and Haitian . Given this threat of violence , women turn to alternative , unofficial routes and dependence upon hired buscones ( informal scouts ) , cousins and other distant family to accompany them across the border . These hired smugglers who have promised to help them , often through force and coercion , trick them instead into forced domestic labor in private homes in Santo Domingo , the capital of Dominican Republic . Hired buscones also sell women and children into the sex slave trade within the Dominican Republic ( brothels and other venues ) or into sexual slavery as an export . Often , mothers need their young children to help provide for the family , which puts the children in vulnerable positions and allows them to fall prey to predators and traffickers .

  "The Basingstoke Canal started at a canal basin , roughly where the cinema in Festival Place is located . From there the canal ran alongside the River Loddon following the line of Eastrop Way . The old canal route passes under the perimeter ring road and then follows a long loop partly on an embankment to pass over small streams and water meadows towards Old Basing , where the route goes around the now ruined palace of Basing House and then through and around the eastern edge of Old Basing . It followed another loop to go over small streams near the Hatch public house ( a lot of this section was built over when constructing the M3 ) and headed across fields on an embankment towards Mapledurwell . The section of the canal from Up Nately to the western entrance of the Greywell Tunnel still exists and is a nature reserve ; there is water in the canal and the canal towpath can be walked . A permissive footpath at the western entrance to the tunnel allows walkers to access public footpaths to get to the eastern entrance of the tunnel . The limit of navigation is about 500m east of the Greywell Tunnel . The renovated sections of the canal can then be navigated east towards West Byfleet where it joins the Wey Navigation , which itself can be navigated to the River Thames at Weybridge .",

  "Weber was also influenced by Kantian ethics , which he nonetheless came to think of as obsolete in a modern age lacking in religious certainties . In this last respect , the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche 's philosophy is evident . According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy , the \" deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber 's ethical worldview \" . Another major influence in Weber 's life was the writings of Karl Marx and the workings of socialist thought in academia and active politics . While Weber shares some of Marx 's consternation with bureaucratic systems and maligns them as being capable of advancing their own logic to the detriment of human freedom and autonomy , Weber views conflict as perpetual and inevitable and does not host the spirit of a materially available utopia . Though the influence of his mother 's Calvinist religiosity is evident throughout Weber 's life and work , and though he maintained a deep , lifelong interest in the study of religions , Weber was open about the fact that he was personally irreligious .",

  "On Elizabeth 's death in 1603 she was succeeded by James I. Strongly influenced by Scotland 's separation from the Catholic Church during the Scottish Reformation , James was intensely interested in Protestant theology , focusing much of his curiosity on the theology of witchcraft . By the early 1590s he had become convinced that he was being plotted against by Scottish witches . After a visit to Denmark , he had attended the trial in 1590 of the North Berwick witches , who were convicted of using witchcraft to send a storm against the ship that carried James and his wife Anne back to Scotland . In 1597 he wrote a book , Daemonologie , instructing his followers that they must denounce and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft . One year after James acceded to the English throne , a law was enacted imposing the death penalty in cases where it was proven that harm had been caused through the use of magic , or corpses had been exhumed for magical purposes . James was , however , sceptical of the evidence presented in witch trials , even to the extent of personally exposing discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches .",

  "In Pound 's Fenollosa translations , unlike previous American translators of Chinese poetry , which tended to work with strict metrical and stanzaic patterns , Pound created free verse translations .

The real achievement of the book , Kenner argues , is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to \" rethink the nature of an English poem \" . These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts , Kenner argues , are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West .

The Carnegie Fund required local towns to do fundraising to match the grants , and to commit to operating the libraries after their construction . In many localities , women 's groups were instrumental in organizing and doing fundraising for the libraries , both at the time of construction and since . Another library located in Hartford City belongs to the Blackford County Historical Society , and a museum is housed in the same building .",

Although the smoke cloud coming from the World Trade Center engulfed the building at one point , there was no structural damage to the building , and there were no reports of physical injuries . Less than an hour after the collapse of the second WTC tower , concern over a bomb threat at the school prompted an evacuation of the surrounding area , as reported live by NBC news reporter Pat Dawson on the Today show . When classes resumed on September 21 , 2001 , students were moved to Brooklyn Technical High School while the Stuyvesant building served as a base of operations for rescue and recovery workers . This caused serious congestion at Brooklyn Tech , and required the students to attend in two shifts , with the Stuyvesant students attending the evening shift .

  "The autonomy question remains on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian @-@ Greek relations as part of the Northern Epirote issue . In 1925 , Albania 's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence , and the Kingdom of Greece abandoned all claims to Northern Epirus . In the 1960s , Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked his Albanian counterpart about giving autonomy to the Greek minority , with no results . In 1991 , after the collapse of the communist regime in Albania , the chairman of Greek minority organization Omonoia called for autonomy for Northern Epirus , on the basis that the rights provided for under the Albanian constitution were highly precarious . This proposal was rejected , spurring the minority 's radical wing to call for a union with Greece . Two years later , Omonoia ’ s chairman was arrested by the Albanian police after publicly stating that the Greek minority goal was the creation of an autonomous region inside the Albanian borders , based on the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu . In 1997 , Albanian analysts stated that the possibility of a Greek minority @-@ inspired breakaway Republic still exists .",
  "The loss of ecclesiastical patronage created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists , who turned to secular patrons . One result of this was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings and walls , with large numbers of private houses of burgesses , lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes , of which over a hundred examples survive . These include the ceiling at Prestongrange , undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr , Commendator of Newbattle , and the long gallery at Pinkie House , painted for Alexander Seaton , Earl of Dunfermline in 1621 . These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism , with elements that call on heraldry , piety , classical myths and allegory . The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century , but began to flourish after the Reformation . There were anonymous portraits of important individuals , including the Earl of Bothwell ( 1556 ) and George , fifth Earl of Seaton ( c . 1570s ) . James VI employed two Flemish artists , Arnold Bronckorst in the early 1580s and Adrian Vanson from around 1584 to 1602 , who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court .",
  "The standard of Rutherford 's accommodation and his personal conduct attracted criticism from some Bible Students and Jehovah 's Witnesses in the 1930s . Walter F.

In July 1939 Olin R. Moyle , legal counsel for the Society , wrote an open letter of resignation to the president , in which he complained about behavior of some members of the Watch Tower Society , including Rutherford himself , that he considered excessive and inappropriate . Moyle mentioned California when discussing \" the difference between the accommodations furnished to you , and your personal attendants , compared with those furnished to some of your brethren . \" Moyle also accused Rutherford of \" unkind treatment of the staff , outbursts of anger , discrimination and vulgar language \" and condemned his allowing the \" glorification of alcohol \" at Bethel . Penton notes that Moyle was a \" teetotaller \" and \" puritanical \" , but claims Rutherford 's drinking habits were \" notorious \" and cites unnamed former Brooklyn Bethel workers who told of occasional difficulties in getting Rutherford to the podium to give public talks due to inebriation .",

  "Vitamin precursors of NAD + were first identified in 1938 , when Conrad Elvehjem showed that liver has an \" anti @-@ black tongue \" activity in the form of nicotinamide . Then , in 1939 , he provided the first strong evidence that niacin is used to synthesize NAD + .

Subsequently , in 1949 , the American biochemists Morris Friedkin and Albert L.

  "During the process of meiotic cell division , an event called genetic recombination or crossing @-@ over can sometimes occur , in which a length of DNA on one chromatid is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding sister chromatid . This has no effect if the alleles on the chromatids are the same , but results in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles if they are different . The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent 's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes ; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait . This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome , or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome . The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome , the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together ; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them . This is known as genetic linkage .",

  "At the front of the Civil Rights Movement , alongside such leaders as Martin Luther King , Jr. and Rosa Parks , but lesser known , was Pauli Murray , an outspoken woman who protested discrimination on the basis of race and sex . She coined the term \" Jane Crow , \" which demonstrated Murray 's belief that Jim Crow laws also negatively impacted African @-@ American women . She was determined to work with other activists to put a halt to both racism and sexism . Murray 's speech , \" Jim Crow and Jane Crow , \" delivered in Washington , D.C. in 1964 , sheds light on the long struggle of African @-@ American women for racial equality and their later fight for equality among the sexes .

[ standing ] ... \" for their freedom and liberty even when \" ... their men ... \" began to experience exhaustion from a long struggle for civil rights . These women were unafraid to stand up for what they believed in and refused to back down from the long and tedious \" battle . \" Murray continues her praise for black women when she says that \" ... one cannot help asking : would the Negro struggle have come this far without the indomitable determination of its women ? \" The \" Negro struggle \" was able to progress partly because of \" ... the indomitable determination of its women . \" African @-@ American women were vital to the Civil Rights Movement and pushed it forward with their own might . They were just as important to the black struggle for racial justice as their male counterparts . Their work ethic and persistence defined African @-@ American women as important to a long fight against racism in America .",

There is some difference of opinion regarding the number of roles that Krauss played in the film .

  "After completing German Ideology , Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding \" the theory and tactics \" of a truly \" revolutionary proletarian movement \" operating from the standpoint of a truly \" scientific materialist \" philosophy .

  "The word \" conscience \" derives etymologically from the Latin conscientia , meaning \" privity of knowledge \" or \" with @-@ knowledge \" . The English word implies internal awareness of a moral standard in the mind concerning the quality of one 's motives , as well as a consciousness of our own actions . Thus conscience considered philosophically may be first , and perhaps most commonly , a largely unexamined \" gut feeling \" or \" vague sense of guilt \" about what ought to be or should have been done . Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation ( or the applicable normative principles , rules or laws ) and can arise from parental , peer group , religious , state or corporate indoctrination , which may or may not be presently consciously acceptable to the person ( \" traditional conscience \" ) . Conscience may be defined as the practical reason employed when applying moral convictions to a situation ( \" critical conscience \" ) . In purportedly morally mature mystical people who have developed this capacity through daily contemplation or meditation combined with selfless service to others , critical conscience can be aided by a \" spark \" of intuitive insight or revelation ( called marifa in Islamic Sufi philosophy and synderesis in medieval Christian scholastic moral philosophy ) . Conscience is accompanied in each case by an internal awareness of ' inner light ' and approbation or ' inner darkness ' and condemnation as well as a resulting conviction of right or duty either followed or declined .",

After separating from Villeneuve 's squadron on 17 August , Généreux was sailing to Corfu when it encountered the British fourth rate . The larger French ship soon overtook the British vessel and a heated exchange followed : French efforts to board Leander were driven back with heavy casualties , and Captain Thompson at one stage successfully raked his opponent , but gradually the heavier weight of Généreux inflicted severe damage to the British ship and after six and a half hours Thompson was forced to surrender . French captain Lejoille then authorised widespread looting of the personal effects of the British crew , whom he also forced to conduct repairs on both ships , an act against the established conventions of naval warfare . The prize was towed to Corfu for repairs , the two battered vessels briefly encountering Mutine , which escaped to the westwards before Généreux could give chase .

The announcement received such a hostile response from supporters that the white strip was replaced by one featuring blue and black hoops , which had originally been earmarked as the team 's third choice kit . In March 2010 the club announced a return to the black and blue stripes for the 2010 – 11 season . In recognition of the centenary of the renaming of the club , the 2012 – 13 kit was red with blue sleeves and collar , and the club 's crest was replaced by the town 's crest . After winning the League Two title in 2012 – 13 , the club gave season ticket holders the chance to vote on what colours the club would play in for the 2013 – 14 season , with the fans choosing to return to a blue and white kit .",

Nutt and Speer admitted that the series was beginning to deteriorate with this game , likely due to the growing reputation of the more powerful Super Nintendo Entertainment System at the time of its release .

  "In 1979 , the concession for passenger transport between Voss and Granvin was transferred from NSB 's bus division to HSD and Bergen – Hardanger – Voss Billag . At the same time , the number of weekly services increased from 14 to 34 . This was largely a result of the 1975 declaration by Hordaland County Council to support the closure of the line . In 1980 , the railway had 60 @,@ 000 passengers . A halt was opened at Mala in 1981 , but then all passenger traffic was terminated on 2 June 1985 .

Freight transport was retained , at first using El 9 , and later shunting locomotives because of the lack of maintenance . From 1 March 1989 , all transport on the line was terminated . NSB wanted to renovate the line and continue operations . Among the plans were to transport metal from the smelters in Hardanger via the Hardanger Line to Continental Europe . This would have required the axle load to be increased . Other plans were to extend some of the departures of the Bergen Commuter Rail from Voss to Granvin or operate commercially profitable tourist trains similar to the service provided on the Flåm Line .",
  "Thrive was recorded at Zoo Studio in Franklin , Tennessee , with producer Mark A. Miller . According to lead vocalist Mark Hall , the idea behind Thrive came from the student ministry he is involved in . As a youth pastor , Hall frequently uses Psalms 1 , which metaphorically compares the concept of a righteous man to a prosperous tree planted by a river . Hall said that many people he has talked with are simply surviving , which he feels contrasts with this — he felt that , although hard times can come upon anyone , people are not put in these situations to simply survive through them , but rather to thrive through the adversity . Using the metaphor , Hall noted that , if one were to pull away all the dirt from around a tree , one would find roots digging into the ground in addition to the limbs of the tree reaching out . Hall elaborated that \" you need to get your strength from God ; you don ’ t get it on your own . If you ’ re all limbs , the thorns of life will knock you over . You need to dig your roots in and let God reach out through you \" . Accordingly , half of the record focuses on ' reaching out ' , while the other half focuses on ' digging deep ' . Hall described the record as being \" an effort to draw a picture of what a believer , a follower of Jesus , would look like if they dug into their roots and understood God and themselves more , and then instead of trying to go be Christian for God , they just let God give them chances to be a Christian \" .",

  "Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey , cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt ; this is especially true with larger species . Teamwork also enables them to defend their kills more easily against other large predators such as hyenas , which may be attracted by vultures from kilometres away in open savannas . Lionesses do most of the hunting ; males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting , except in the case of larger quarry such as giraffe and buffalo . In typical hunts , each lioness has a favoured position in the group , either stalking prey on the \" wing \" then attacking , or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses . There is evidence that male lions are just as successful at hunting as females ; they are solo hunters who ambush prey in small bush . Young lions first display stalking behaviour around three months of age , although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old . They begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two .",

  "Historians note that women during the Tang dynasty were brazen , assertive , active , and relatively more socially liberated than Song women . Women of the Song period are typically seen as well educated and interested in expressing themselves through poetry , yet more reserved , respectful , \" slender , petite and dainty , \" according to Gernet . Evidence of foot binding as a new trend in the Southern Song period certainly reinforces this notion . However , the greater number of documents due to more widespread printing reveal a much more complex and rich reality about family life and Song women . Through written stories , legal cases , and other documents , many different sources show that Song women held considerable clout in family decision @-@ making , and some were quite economically savvy . Men dominated the public sphere , while affluent wives spent most of their time indoors enjoying leisure activities and managing the household . However , women of the lower and middle classes were not solely bound to the domestic sphere . It was common for women to manage town inns , some to manage restaurants , farmers ' daughters to weave mats and sell them on their own behalf , midwives to deliver babies , Buddhist nuns to study religious texts and sutras , female nurses to assist physicians , and women to keep a close eye on their own financial affairs . In the case of the latter , legal case documents describe childless widows who accused their nephews of stealing their property . There are also numerous mentions of women drawing upon their dowries to help their husband 's sisters marry into other prominent families .",

  "In 1616 an act in Privy council commanded every parish to establish a school \" where convenient means may be had \" . After the Parliament of Scotland ratified this law and the Education Act of 1633 , a tax on local landowners was introduced to provide the necessary endowment . From 1638 Scotland underwent a \" second Reformation \" , with widespread support for a National Covenant , objecting to the Charles I 's liturgical innovations and reaffirming the Calvinism and Presbyterianism of the kirk . After the Bishop 's Wars ( 1639 – 40 ) , Scotland had virtual independence from the government in Westminster . Education remained fundamental to the ideas of the Covenanters . A loophole which allowed evasion of the education tax was closed in the Education Act of 1646 , which established a solid institutional foundation for schools on Covenanter principles , emphasising the role of presbyteries in supervision . Although the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 brought a reversal to the 1633 position , in 1696 new legislation restored the provisions of 1646 together with means of enforcement \" more suitable to the age \" and underlined the aim of having a school in every parish . In rural communities these acts obliged local landowners ( heritors ) to provide a schoolhouse and pay a schoolmaster , known in Scotland as a dominie , while ministers and local presbyteries oversaw the quality of the education . In many Scottish towns , burgh schools were operated by local councils . By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands , but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas .",

  "Finally , the third major factor behind the resolution of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009 . While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland , this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets . One sign of the success of the above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $ 1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011 . This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system , with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands , a clean bill of health . The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H.

  "The first known record of Golubac is in Hungarian sources from 1335 , when it was occupied by Hungarian military .

  "During the debate over the length of the course , The New York Times brought up the issue of the cloistered and undemocratic nature of student life at West Point . Also , starting with Harvard University in 1869 , civilian universities had begun grading students on academic performance alone , but West Point had retained the old \" whole man \" concept of education . MacArthur sought to modernize the system , expanding the concept of military character to include bearing , leadership , efficiency and athletic performance . He formalized the hitherto unwritten Cadet Honor Code in 1922 when he formed the Cadet Honor Committee to review alleged code violations . Elected by the cadets themselves , it had no authority to punish , but acted as a kind of grand jury , reporting offenses to the commandant . MacArthur attempted to end hazing by using officers rather than upperclassmen to train the plebes .",

  "Cartman dresses like Adolf Hitler , the leader of the Nazi Party ; Cartman occasionally says \" Sieg Heil \" , a common phrase previously used in Nazi Germany . Comedy Central had reservations about the idea and sought ideas for other possible costumes , but Parker and Stone insisted it had to be the Hitler costume . Once the episode aired , however , the two received very few letters from upset viewers over the costume ; Parker attributed this to the fact that people were becoming more familiar with the Cartman character , and thus recognized that most of what he said and did was usually wrong .

  "The earliest recorded use of the Lion rampant as a royal emblem in Scotland was by Alexander II in 1222 ; with the additional embellishment of a double border set with lilies occurring during the reign of Alexander III ( 1249 – 1286 ) . This emblem occupied the shield of the royal coat of arms of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland which , together with a royal banner displaying the same , was used by the King of Scots until the Union of the Crowns in 1603 , when James VI acceded to the thrones of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Ireland . Since 1603 , the Lion rampant of Scotland has been incorporated into both the royal arms and royal banners of successive Scottish then British monarchs in order to symbolise Scotland ; as can be seen today in the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom . Although now officially restricted to use by representatives of the Sovereign and at royal residences , the Royal Banner continues to be one of Scotland 's most recognisable symbols .",

  "With the victory of the Mexicans over the Spanish imperial army in 1821 , the Viceroyalty of New Spain came to a conclusion . The newly independent Mexican Congress still desired that King Ferdinand VII , or another member of the House of Bourbon , agree to be installed as Emperor of Mexico , thereby forming a type of personal union with Spain . The Spanish monarchy , however , refused to recognise the new state , and decreed that it would allow no other European prince to take the throne of Mexico . Thus , the Mexican Agustín de Iturbide was crowned as Augustine I on 19 May 1822 , with an official decree of confirmation issued two days following . Only a few months later , Augustine dissolved a factious congress , thereby prompting an enraged Antonio López de Santa Anna to mount a coup , which led to the declaration of a republic on 1 December 1822 .

  "The ectomycorrhizae of T. vaccinum has been the subject of considerable research . Ectomycorrhizae of Tricholoma species can vary considerably among species in the genus , and differences in the structure of rhizomorphs ( a cordlike fusions of hyphae resembling a root ) have been used to key out species . Mycorrhizae formed with Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) are conspicuously hairy with numerous hyphae . The hyphae are partly densely interconnected to rhizomorphs that have a pigment in their outer membrane . The emanating hyphae mostly lack \" contact septae \" ( fully developed simple septae ) and contact clamps , and the rhizomorph hyphae vary markedly in diameter . The Hartig net ( a network of hyphae that extend into the root ) formed by T. vaccinum grows more deeply towards the epidermis , is composed of more rows of hyphae and has more tannin cells in close proximity to the epidermis , and consequently , fewer cortical cells in this position . It is here that the rhizomorphs make the closest contact with the rootlets . The mantle is prosenchymatous , meaning that the constituent hyphae are loosely organized with spaces between them . A combination of techniques including freeze fracturing and scanning electron microscopy has been used to probe the microstructure of the ectomycorrhizae , including inner mantle thickness and the nature of the interface between the Hartig net and host cells . Several fungal genes specifically expressed during ectomycorrhizal interaction between T. vaccinum and Picea abies have been identified , including some involved in a plant pathogen response , nutrient exchange and growth in the plant , signal transduction , and stress response . The first characterized fungal aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme , ALD1 , helps circumvent ethanol stress — a critical function in mycorrhizal habitats .",

  "Spinal polio , the most common form of paralytic poliomyelitis , results from viral invasion of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells , or the ventral ( front ) grey matter section in the spinal column , which are responsible for movement of the muscles , including those of the trunk , limbs , and the intercostal muscles .

  "The American white ibis prefers to eat crayfish and other crustaceans , but also takes aquatic insects and small fish . Outside the nesting season , the diet is highly variable , as abundance and types of prey depend on the both region and habitat . In Los Llanos , located on the border of Columbia and Venezuela , the most frequent prey are insects , such as fly larvae and beetles . Generally in North America the main prey are crustaceans , mostly crayfish . In the Everglades and cypress swamps , the diet is primarily made up of crayfish , while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish . American white ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs . The tactile nature of the ibis 's probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill . In the Everglades , this means that crayfish make up a large part of the diet , but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas . Although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises , prey switching to fish does occur if fish are found in great abundance . It is unclear whether the fish are more easily caught if overcrowded , or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfish — normally , fish are more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis 's bill more easily . Fish are a more energy @-@ rich source of food for the American white ibis . In the breeding season , American white ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Island travelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish , than nearby saltwater areas where fiddler crabs predominated , indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young . This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony ; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes .",

  "Final Fantasy Type @-@ 0 is set within Orience , a land divided between four nations or \" Crystal States \" . Each nation has crystals of power based on the Four Symbols , which are in turn their national emblems . The Dominion of Rubrum uses the Vermillion Bird Crystal , which controls magic ; the Militesi Empire controls the White Tiger Crystal , containing the power of science and weapons ; the Kingdom of Concordia uses the Azure Dragon Crystal , containing the power of Dragons ; and the Lorican Alliance is home to the Black Tortoise Crystal , containing the power of shielding . Each nation has an academy , or Peristylium , to research and protect the country 's respective crystal . The crystals have the ability to mark humans as their countries ' servants . These servants , called l 'Cie , are branded with a symbol and are given a \" Focus \" , a task to complete . While blessed with long life and the ability to transform into crystal , l 'Cie are cursed to lose their memories over time . The people of Orience also lose their memories of the dead so they will not be held back by any past regrets and continue strengthening their souls through conflict , a mechanism put in place by the crystals for the convenience of the deities who crafted them . The main aim of many characters is to become Agito , a legendary figure who will appear and save the world from Tempus Finis , an apocalyptic event that will destroy Orience .",

  "One of the performance issues addressed by the waffle @-@ iron filter is that in many waveguide filters the attenuation is dependent on the transmission modes of the incident signal and some filters can be quite bad at suppressing spurious modes which may be contained in this signal . For instance , with the corrugated waveguide filter , on which the waffle @-@ iron filter is based , attenuation of TEn0 modes in the stopband is strongly dependent on the mode number . This is not the case with the waffle @-@ iron filter which attenuates all TEn0 modes nearly equally up to a certain frequency . The limit is the frequency at which the distance between the metal teeth is greater than half the free @-@ space wavelength of the signal . The reason for the waffle @-@ iron design 's good performance in this respect is that the distance between the teeth is the same in both the longitudinal and transverse directions and nearly the same in all directions in between . This makes the waffle @-@ iron nearly isotropic to TEM waves in all these directions . Since any TEn0 mode wave can be decomposed into two TEM mode waves travelling in different diagonal directions , all TEn0 modes are affected nearly equally .",

  "A continuous map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups . In particular , if the map is a continuous bijection ( a homeomorphism ) , so that the two spaces have the same topology , then their i @-@ th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i . However , the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point ( as does a Euclidean space of any dimension ) , and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle , so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces . Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate , it can also make certain computations easier .",
  "Setting <formula> and taking <formula> ( i.e. the rotational wind speed is dominant ) leads to the solution for <formula> given above . This derivation assumes that total energy input and loss within the system can be approximated by their values at the radius of maximum wind . The inclusion of <formula> acts to multiply the total heat input rate by the factor <formula> . Mathematically , this has the effect of replacing <formula> with <formula> in the denominator of the Carnot efficiency .",

As the first ghost had seemingly vanished , this charge against Kent — that he murdered Elizabeth — was never acted on , but through repeated questioning of Fanny 's ghost it was divined that she had died not from the effects of smallpox , but rather from arsenic poisoning .

  "These initial concerns , however , were short lived , at least in the beginning as the British government provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue . Shortly thereafter the wartime direction of trade began when the British asked the Australian government to place certain restrictions upon overseas trade in order to secure resources vital to the war effort and to limit the ability of the Central Powers from obtaining these goods from Commonwealth nations via neutral third parties . To an extent these restrictions served to reduce the ability of Australian producers to find buyers for their products , at least initially , however , in many cases the British stepped in to buy these goods , thus alleviating Australian concerns about a significant reduction in the standard of living . This understanding proved particularly beneficial for the wool and wheat industries , where the British government undertook to buy Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them .",

  "Sweetheart of the Rodeo is the sixth album by American rock band The Byrds and was released on August 30 , 1968 on Columbia Records ( see 1968 in music ) . Recorded with the addition of country rock pioneer Gram Parsons , it was influential as the first major country rock album by an established act and represented a stylistic move away from the psychedelic rock of the band 's previous LP , The Notorious Byrd Brothers . The Byrds had occasionally experimented with country music on their four previous albums , but Sweetheart of the Rodeo represented their fullest immersion into the genre thus far . The album was also responsible for bringing Gram Parsons , who had joined The Byrds prior to the recording of the album , to the attention of a mainstream rock audience for the first time . Thus , the album can be seen as an important chapter in Parsons ' personal and musical crusade to make country music fashionable for a young audience .",

  "Serotonin toxicity has a characteristic picture which is generally hard to confuse with other medical conditions , but in some situations it may go unrecognized because it may be mistaken for a viral illness , anxiety , neurological disorder , anticholinergic poisoning , sympathomimetic toxicity , or worsening psychiatric condition . The condition most often confused with serotonin syndrome is neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) . The clinical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome share some features which can make differentiating them difficult . In both conditions , autonomic dysfunction and altered mental status develop . However , they are actually very different conditions with different underlying dysfunction ( serotonin excess vs dopamine blockade ) . Both the time course and the clinical features of NMS differ significantly from those of serotonin toxicity . Serotonin toxicity has a rapid onset after the administration of a serotonergic drug and responds to serotonin blockade such as drugs like chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine . Dopamine receptor blockade ( NMS ) has a slow onset and typically evolves over several days after administration of a neuroleptic drug and responds to dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine .",

  "Lactate uptake by the liver is diminished with metformin administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis , a process which metformin inhibits . In healthy individuals , this slight excess is simply cleared by other mechanisms ( including uptake by the kidneys , when their function is unimpaired ) , and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs . When impaired kidney function is present , however , clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced , leading to increased levels of both , and possibly causing a buildup of lactic acid . Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate , any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication to its use .

  "As a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling , brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active . When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity , the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull , using electroencephalography ( EEG ) or magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . EEG recordings , along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats , show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active , even during sleep .

  "In 1875 , the first large canal , the South Jordan Canal , was completed and it brought water to the area above the bluffs of the Jordan River for the first time . All told , five large canals that originated from the dams in the Jordan Narrows were completed by 1883 . A second dam was built in 1890 a few miles downstream from the first dam and was constructed to better regulate the flow of two canals . Both dams have been rebuilt in subsequent years and operate as diversion points for canals rather than impounding water by the use of sluice gates and head gates . The drought of 1901 – 1902 caused the Jordan River , on occasion , to stop flowing , and in response to the drought a pumping plant was installed at the outlet from Utah Lake .

Twice , during the droughts of 1934 and 1992 , Utah Lake levels dropped so low that the pumps were rendered useless and the Jordan River actually ran dry .

  "The melodies played by the accompaniment mainly fall into three broad categories . The first is the aria . The arias of Peking opera can be further divided into those of the Erhuang and Xipi varieties . An example of an aria is wawa diao , an aria in the Xipi style that is sung by a young Sheng to indicate heightened emotion . The second type of melody heard in Peking opera is the fixed @-@ tune melody , or qupai . These are instrumental tunes that serve a wider range of purposes than arias . Examples include the \" Water Dragon Tune \" ( shui long yin ) , which generally denotes the arrival of an important person , and \" Triple Thrust \" ( ji san qiang ) , which may signal a feast or banquet . The final type of musical accompaniment is the percussion pattern . Such patterns provide context to the music in ways similar to the fixed @-@ tune melodies . For example , there are as many as 48 different percussion patterns that accompany stage entrances . Each one identifies the entering character by his or her individual rank and personality .",

  "From 1936 on , several admirers tried unsuccessfully to persuade Sorabji to record Opus clavicembalisticum . Given that Sorabji had not recorded any of his works , and that none of them had been published since 1931 , his friends and admirers began to be concerned about the fate of his output . The most ambitious attempt to ensure the preservation of his music and writings was initiated by Frank Holliday ( 1912 – 1997 ) , who met Sorabji in 1937 and was his closest friend for about four decades . In the early 1950s Holliday organised the presentation of a letter inviting Sorabji to make recordings of his own music . Sorabji received the letter in 1953 , but made no recordings then , in spite of the enclosed cheque for 121 guineas ( just over £ 127 ) . Holliday 's perseverance and closeness to Sorabji did , however , eventually change Sorabji 's attitude , and several recordings were made in Sorabji 's house between 1962 and 1968 . Holliday also helped with the WNCN broadcast of Sorabji 's music in 1970 ( which took place without Sorabji 's consent ) . Their friendship ended in 1979 as a result of disagreements about some of Sorabji 's decisions .",

The pitfall traps of protocarnivorous plants , such as some Heliamphora species and Darlingtonia californica , are so similar to those of true carnivorous plants that the only reason they may be considered protocarnivorous instead of carnivorous is that they do not produce their own digestive enzymes . There are also protocarnivorous bromeliads that form a pitfall trap in an \" urn \" of rosetted leaves that are held together tightly .

  "In medieval Europe , the pelican was thought to be particularly attentive to her young , to the point of providing her own blood by wounding her own breast when no other food was available . As a result , the pelican came to symbolise the Passion of Jesus and the Eucharist , and usurped the image of the lamb and the flag . A reference to this mythical characteristic is contained for example in the hymn by Saint Thomas Aquinas , \" Adoro te devote \" or \" Humbly We Adore Thee \" , where in the penultimate verse he describes Christ as the \" loving divine pelican , able to provide nourishment from his breast \" . Elizabeth I of England adopted the symbol , portraying herself as the \" mother of the Church of England \" .

A pelican feeding her young is depicted in an oval panel at the bottom of the title page of the first ( 1611 ) edition of the King James Bible .

  "From March 1965 until mid @-@ 1967 , Melbourne underwent a regular pattern of deployments to Southeast Asia , exercises , and flag @-@ showing visits to nations in the Asia @-@ Pacific region . Several of the Southeast Asian deployments were related to the Indonesia – Malaysia confrontation , and involved participation in show of force exercises off the coast of Malaysia . During 1965 and 1966 , Melbourne escorted sister ship HMAS Sydney , which had been recommissioned as a troop transport , for short periods during the latter 's first , third , and fourth transport voyages to Vietnam . Despite the carrier being the centrepiece of several plans to involve Australian forces in the Vietnam War , the escort runs were the extent of Melbourne 's participation in the conflict , and the carrier remained outside the Market Time area while Sydney and her other escorts proceeded to Vũng Tàu . As the carrier was optimised for anti @-@ submarine warfare , there was little need for her at the start of the war . Utilising the carrier was suggested again by RAN officials in March 1966 , when the United States Seventh Fleet was having difficulties maintaining anti @-@ submarine patrols around Yankee Station , but Melbourne could only remain on station for a single , ten @-@ day period , a third of the time that US carriers were operational for on rotating deployments . Seventh Fleet staff suggested in April 1967 that Melbourne deploy in the anti @-@ submarine role , but nothing came of these talks . Consideration was also given to using Melbourne as a floating helicopter base , but only ten Wessex helicopters could be provided , and modifications were required for them to operate as troop carriers . Both options were made more prohibitive by the need to supply at least two escorts for the carrier at a time when the RAN was having difficulty meeting deployment commitments with the available destroyers and destroyer escorts .",

  "The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes . Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation , macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit . \" Cargo \" proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals , which are bound by importins , while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins . The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases , enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate to release energy . The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran , which can bind either GTP or GDP ( guanosine diphosphate ) , depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm . Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo , exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo .",

  "The middle decades of the 20th century saw the rise of molecular biology , and with it an understanding of the chemical nature of genes as sequences of DNA and of their relationship — through the genetic code — to protein sequences . At the same time , increasingly powerful techniques for analyzing proteins , such as protein electrophoresis and sequencing , brought biochemical phenomena into realm of the synthetic theory of evolution . In the early 1960s , biochemists Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed the molecular clock hypothesis ( MCH ) : that sequence differences between homologous proteins could be used to calculate the time since two species diverged . By 1969 , Motoo Kimura and others provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock , arguing that — at the molecular level at least — most genetic mutations are neither harmful nor helpful and that mutation and genetic drift ( rather than natural selection ) cause a large portion of genetic change : the neutral theory of molecular evolution . Studies of protein differences within species also brought molecular data to bear on population genetics by providing estimates of the level of heterozygosity in natural populations .",

For critic Gerald Martin , the dictator novel marks the end of the Boom and even ( as he says of Roa Bastos 's I , the Supreme ) “ the end of an entire era in Latin American history , the era which had stretched from Sarmiento 's Facundo in 1845 . \" In the 1970s , many dictator novels focused on the figure “ of the aging dictator , prey to the boredom of a limitless power he is on the verge of losing . ”",

  "Two different kelly pool @-@ based derivations for behind the eight ball are provided in diverse sources . As noted , in kelly pool each player is randomly assigned a specific ball of the fifteen ball rack , which must be made in numerical order . The game ends when any player makes his assigned ball . Based on these rules , one origin theory holds that when a large number of players are participating , players assigned balls numerically higher than 8 — that is , balls that are behind the 8 ball in order — have little chance of winning . This is a result of the likelihood that random distribution will result in multiple players with assigned balls numbered lower than 8 having an opportunity to shoot first , and that with such large a number of players at least one will come to the table with the opportunity to shoot at his assigned ball .",

  "Pallid sturgeon are generally bottom feeders , skimming the sandy reaches of the various rivers and streams in their habitat .

He put his faith in his coming audience with the King , but it never came , for King Ferdinand died on January 25 , 1516 . The regency of Castile passed on to Ximenez Cisneros and Adrian of Utrecht who were guardians for the under @-@ age Prince Charles . Las Casas was resolved to see Prince Charles who resided in Flanders , but on his way there he passed Madrid and delivered to the regents a written account of the situation in the Indies and his proposed remedies . This was his \" Memorial de Remedios para Las Indias \" of 1516 . In this early work , Las Casas advocated importing Black slaves from Africa to relieve the suffering Indians , a stance he later retracted , becoming an advocate for the Africans in the colonies as well . This shows that Las Casas 's first concern was not to end slavery as an institution , but to end the physical abuse and suffering of the Indians . In keeping with the legal and moral doctrine of the time Las Casas believed that slavery could be justified if it was the result of Just War , and at the time he assumed that the enslavement of Africans was justified . Worried by the visions that Las Casas had drawn up of the situation in the Indies , Cardenal Cisneros decided to send a group of Hieronymite friars to take over the government of the islands .",

Unbeknownst to the Russians , Tōgō had defeated the ships from Port Arthur during the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August and the Russian squadron from Vladivostok was intercepted off Ulsan , Korea by the 2nd Division . The steering of the Russian cruiser Rurik was damaged early in the battle and the Russians made several attempts to prevent the Japanese from concentrating fire on her , but were ultimately forced to abandon her to her fate . Kamimura left Rurik to the tender ministrations of his reinforcements and pursued the two remaining Russian ships for a time before breaking off pursuit prematurely based on an incorrect report that Izumo had expended most of her ammunition . That ship was hit over 20 times , but suffered fewer than 20 men killed or wounded . Iwate , in contrast , was hit far fewer times , but one of them started a major ammunition fire that killed or wounded dozens of men .

His treatise , Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody , published in 1584 when he was aged 18 , was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue , Scots , to which he applied Renaissance principles .

He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians , the Castalian Band , which included among others William Fowler and Alexander Montgomerie , the latter being a favourite of the King .

  "Like many plants in south @-@ west Western Australia , B. attenuata is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent . Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire : reseeders are killed by fire , but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank , thus promoting recruitment of the next generation ; resprouters survive fire , resprouting from a lignotuber or , more rarely , epicormic buds protected by thick bark . Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber , B. attenuata is one of the latter group , with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire . It is moderately serotinous , storing only one tenth the number of seeds in its seed bank as the reseeding B. hookeriana which it coexists with on sand dunes in scrub at Eneabba north of Perth . Even then , many of its follicles do not release seed after a fire , but instead after successive autumn rains . An experiment simulating wet weather following a fire saw a series of Banksia attenuata cones with follicles subjected to twice weekly immersions in water after being heated in a ring Bunsen flame to around 500 – 600 ° C ( 932 – 1 @,@ 112 ° F ) for two minutes . Cones that had been exposed to water for more weeks had more seed released from follicles over time ; around 40 % released at three weeks , increasing steadily to almost 90 % at ten weeks , compared with a series of controls ( which were kept dry ) of which fewer than 10 % of seed released . Thus , the seed remains in the follicles until successive rains result in seed dispersal in the wetter winter ( instead of dryer summer ) , increasing the chance of survival . After the follicle is split , the seed and separator are exposed to the elements . The wings of the woody separator are hygroscopic , and move together when wet , and spread and curl apart when dry . The seed is gradually drawn out by the movement with each wetting . Once released , seed germinates at temperatures between 15 and 20 ° C ( 59 and 68 ° F ) to optimise timing with autumn and winter rains and hence maximise chance of survival . Still , many seedlings die off in the hot and dry summer months . Seedling survival for the species is lower than for banksias which regenerate by seeding over time . Despite this , the longevity of mature plants allows for maintenance of population until favourable years enable better survival of young plants . As they mature , plants are less likely to perish , and estimated to live for 300 years or more . Analyzing the seed bank and longitudinal results over fifteen years on the Eneabba sandplain showed that B. attenuata would become more abundant over time with fire intervals averaging between 6 and 20 years , peaking with intervals around 10 to 12 years , compared with longer intervals for the reseeders B. hookeriana and B. prionotes . Placed against its rivals , B. attenuata would be dominant between 8 and 10 or 11 years , but at longer intervals is outcompeted by B. hookeriana . Variability in the timing between fires allows all three species to coexist . Exaggerated good and bad weather conditions favours B. attenuata over the reseeding species , which suffer more .",

Reflecting on the music composition for the album , Bray noted : \" I 've always kind of made the rib cage and the skeleton of the songs already — she 's there for the last things like the eyebrows and the haircut . \" The opening track \" Material Girl \" was written by Peter Brown and Roberta Rans . Madonna explained that the concept of the song was similar to her life 's situation at that time . According to her , the song was provocative , hence she was attracted to it . \" Material Girl \" incorporated new wave music and consists of synth arrangements with a robotic voice repeating the hook .

However , Rodgers initially felt that the song did not have a good enough hook and was not suitable for Madonna , but subsequently changed his opinion after the hook was stuck in his mind . He credits Madonna with recognizing the song 's potential : \" I handed my apology to Madonna and said , ' you know ... if it 's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days , it must be something . So let 's do it . ' \" \" Like a Virgin \" is a dance @-@ oriented song , composed of two hooks . Madonna 's voice is heard in a high register while a continuous arrangement of drums are heard along the bassline . According to author Rikky Rooksby , the lyrics of the song are ambiguous and consist of hidden innuendo . In sexual terms , the lyrics can be interpreted in different ways for different people .",

The former was reflected in how the circus members come together at the end , while the latter was reflected in the character Moe .

  "Gernsback 's initial editorial approach was to blend instruction with entertainment ; he believed science fiction could educate readers . His audience rapidly showed a preference for implausible adventures , however , and the movement away from Gernsback 's idealism accelerated when the magazine changed hands in 1929 . Despite this , Gernsback had an enormous impact on the field : the creation of a specialist magazine for science fiction spawned an entire genre publishing industry . The letter columns in Amazing , where fans could make contact with each other , led to the formation of science fiction fandom , which in turn had a strong influence on the development of the field . Writers whose first story was published in the magazine include Isaac Asimov , Howard Fast , Ursula K. Le Guin , Roger Zelazny , and Thomas M. Disch . Overall , though , Amazing itself was rarely an influential magazine within the genre . Some critics have commented that by \" ghettoizing \" science fiction , Gernsback in fact did harm to its literary growth , but this viewpoint has been countered by the argument that science fiction needed an independent market to develop in to reach its potential .",

The club won the league for the first time , finishing one point ahead of Celtic and \" New Firm rivals \" Aberdeen in a tightly fought league campaign . Milne 's 16 goals in the league , playing wide right , were a significant contribution to United 's league win . One of the most high profile of these goals was on 20 April when he scored the winning goal in a 3 – 2 win over Celtic at Parkhead ; he controlled an Eamonn Bannon cross from the right on his chest and volleyed the ball from 20 yards out past Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner .

  "The first known bigeye sand tiger was a female 1 @.@ 7 m ( 5 @.@ 6 ft ) long caught off Madeira in April 1941 , on a longline set for black scabbardfish ( Aphanopus carbo ) . The specimen was mounted and later formed the basis for a scientific description authored by German ichthyologist Günther Maul in a 1955 article for Notulae Naturae . He named the species noronhai in honor of Adolfo César de Noronha , the late Director of the Funchal Museum . Maul assigned his new species to the genus Carcharias , which at the time was used for all members of the sand tiger shark family . When the Odontaspis came to be recognized as a valid genus separate from Carcharias , the bigeye sand tiger was reassigned as well given its resemblance to the smalltooth sand tiger ( O. ferox ) .

  "According to the so @-@ called Nice model , after the formation of the Solar System , the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly , influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals . After 500 – 600 million years ( about 4 billion years ago ) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2 : 1 resonance : Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits . This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets , causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt . The planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards , while themselves moving outwards . These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner , moving the planets ' orbits outwards while they moved inwards . This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter , whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System . This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward . Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud ; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc . This scenario explains the Kuiper belt 's and scattered disc 's present low mass . Some of the scattered objects , including Pluto , became gravitationally tied to Neptune 's orbit , forcing them into mean @-@ motion resonances . Eventually , friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again .",
